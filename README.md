Hi there, Iʼm Iryna Valchak

Iʼll be glad if you take a look at my test task ¨SaaS Landing Page Template¨ for Junior HTML Developer.

Here are key points about me:

   Node.js with hands-on experience delivering high-quality web solutions.

2) Language proficiency:
   Fluent in English (C1), skilled in professional communication and negotiations. Currently advancing in German (B1) as
   a second foreign language.

3) Education:
   Graduated with honours from IT Step Academy, specialising in "Development and Promotion of Web Projects" and holding
   an international diploma. Currently, I'm remotely (studying on an individual schedule) pursuing a degree in English
   Translation and Interpretation, with a focus on German language studies.

4) Tutoring and teaching experience:
   I have 5+ years specialising in IT English, spoken English tutoring, and programming mentoring (HTML, CSS,
   JavaScript).

5) Cultural fluency:
   Active participant in English-speaking clubs and regular communicator with native speakers, enhancing cross-cultural
   understanding and conversational skills.

I am passionate about bridging the gap between technology and communication, and I am always eager to take on
challenging projects that require creative problem-solving.
